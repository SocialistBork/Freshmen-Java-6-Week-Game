III:int[] arr = new int[4];
    for (int j = 0; i < arr.length; i++)

Question:
Refer to the following code segment. Assume arr is an array of int values.

int sum = arr[0], i = 0;
while (i < arr.length)
{
	i++;
	sum += arr[i];
}


What will be the result when the code is run?
Options: 
An infinate loop
Runtime error
The sum of arr[0],arr[1]...arr[arr.length-1] will be stored in sum.
The sum of arr[0],arr[1]...arr[arr.length] will be stored in sum. 
Answer: Runtime error
