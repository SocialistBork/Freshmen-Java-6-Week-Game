# 2020 Final Java Project
This is the code and files that were created for the final coding project in my Freshmen year of High School. 
The main objective of the game is to help Java beginners learn the Java Programing language. The game covers loops, if-else structures, GUI, inhertence, and methods/classes.

The project itself utilizes all the concpets that were taught throughout the school year.

This code is meant to be kept so that I can remember it as a reference as to how far I went back. I do not expect to be updating to changing the game.
