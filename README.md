# 2020 Final Java Project
This is the code and files that were created for the final coding project in my Freshmen year of High School. 
The main objective of the game is to help Java beginners learn the Java Programing language. The game covers loops, if-else structures, GUI, inhertence, and methods/classes.

The project itself utilizes all the concpets that were taught throughout the school year.
